# ECG processing
Project Submission for the Buidl with AI hackathon

## Project Cardiavita
Over 17.7 deaths every year are reported to be caused by Cardiovascular diseases. This accounts for 31% of the total number of deaths in the world. 

We believe that with the power of Google Neural networks, we can extract relevant patterns in heart data especially ECG data which can help predict heart attacks and other cardiovascular diseases. 

## Project Requirements
* Matlab for Data Preprocessing
* Tensorflow for Neural Networks
